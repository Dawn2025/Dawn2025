Data Analyst | Lifelong Learner
---------------------------------------------------


👋 Hi there! I’m Dawn. I am from London. My background applicable to this role is in business and organisational management. I’ve developed transferable skill in customer relations, stakeholder management, problem-solving skills, and the ability to work in fast-paced environments.

I recently achieved an Advanced Level 3 Data Analytics Training Course, where I became proficient in tools like PowerPoint, Excel, Word, and Access. These skills provided me with a solid foundation for working with data and started my passion for data analytics. Enrolling in the  Data Technician Bootcamp program with Just IT, has provided me with skills in data collection, cleaning, analysis, and visualization.
I have used tools such Python, SQL, Excel, Power BI, and Tableau, learning theory and applying them to case studies.  I’m really enjoying learning how to visualised data to different organisational needs.

My goal is to use my work experience and data management training to expand my employment opportunities where I can apply my technical skills while continuing to learn from experienced professionals.

I enjoy trying new foods, listening to music and quality time with family.
